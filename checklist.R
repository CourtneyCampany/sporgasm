### here is a checklist of what is compelted for both measurement campaigns

##FINISHED: all stats in indiviudal scripts in stats folder

#1) frond length (terrestrial > epi/hemi), no site 
#2) Lamina area (terrestrial broadly greater but niche * site interaction)
#3) Stipe length (terrestrial > epi/hemi, site diff in terresrial)
#####likely need a non parametric with #3

#4) Chlorophyll (epiphyte has lower chlorophyll)
