(Brodribb 2017): A passive linkage between leaf water status and guard cell turgor observed in extant basal vascular plants appears to be sufficient to prevent xylem cavitation during diurnal changes in evaporative demand (Martins et al., 2015). However, without more sophisticated mechanisms to reduce guard cell turgor and produce complete stomatal closure, it has been hypothesized that passive closure does not provide a sufficiently tight stomatal seal capable of preventing ferns and lycophytes from rapidly reaching critical leaf water potentials when soil water is depleted during drought (McAdam and Brodribb, 2013). As a result, ferns and lycophytes in dry environments rely on either a high plant capacitance or low stomatal density (McAdam and Brodribb, 2013), desiccation tolerance (Hietz, 2010), and in some cases, rather cavitation-resistant xylem (Baer et al., 2016).  
We foudn that cavaitaion-resistant xylem where not the case here (see review too)


**Allomteric relationships between lamina area and total frond length had similar slopes across all three life forms (Figure 1a). This broad convergence in frond allometry suggests that tropical ferns build leaf structures in predictable proportions, despite variation in frond structural traits.**

Total chlorophyll content was similar between terrestrial and epiphytic species, although epiphytic species had a lower range of chlorophyll content.  Hemi-epiphytic species had similar chlorophyll content to terrestrial species, but were 37 % higher than epiphytic species (*P = 0.031).
